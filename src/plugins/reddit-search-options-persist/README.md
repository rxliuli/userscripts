# Reddit Search Options Persist

A userscript that keeps your Reddit search filters (sort, time range, type) when searching with new keywords.

## What it does

Reddit resets all search options every time you enter a new search term. This userscript intercepts the search input and preserves your filter preferences (sort order, time range, search type) when you perform a new search.

## Features

- **Preserves Sort Order**: Keeps your sort preference (relevance, hot, top, new, comments)
- **Preserves Time Range**: Maintains time filter (hour, day, week, month, year, all time)
- **Preserves Search Type**: Retains type filter (posts, comments, communities, people)
- **Subreddit & Site-wide**: Works in both subreddit-specific and global Reddit search
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, works entirely in the browser

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
2. Download the userscript from <https://github.com/rxliuli/userscripts/releases/latest/download/reddit-search-options-persist.user.js>

## How to Use

1. **Visit Reddit**: Navigate to any Reddit page
2. **Perform a Search**: Use the search bar with your preferred filters (sort, time, type)
3. **Search Again**: Enter a new search term and press Enter
4. **Filters Preserved**: Your previous filter settings are automatically applied to the new search
